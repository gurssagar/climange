# Installing a Svelte Project

Follow these steps to install and set up a Svelte project on your local machine:

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure that you have the following software installed on your computer:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/): Svelte projects require Node.js to run.

## Installation Steps

1. **Clone the Repository**: Open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you want to store the Svelte project. Use the following command to clone the project repository:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   ```

   Replace `<repository_url>` with the URL of the Git repository you want to clone.

2. **Change Directory**: Navigate into the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd <project_directory>
   ```

   Replace `<project_directory>` with the name of the directory where the project was cloned.

3. **Install Dependencies**: Use `npm` (Node Package Manager) to install the project's dependencies. Run the following command:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

   This command will download and install all the required packages and libraries specified in the project's `package.json` file.

4. **Start the Development Server**: To run the Svelte project locally, start the development server with the following command:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   This will launch a development server and provide you with a local URL (usually `http://localhost:5173`) where you can access the Svelte application in your web browser.

5. **Access the Svelte App**: Open your web browser and navigate to the provided local URL to access and interact with the Svelte application.

You've successfully installed and set up a Svelte project on your local machine. You can now start developing and customizing the Svelte app according to your project's requirements.

Happy coding!
